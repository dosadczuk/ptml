 * The <span> HTML element is a generic inline container for phrasing
 * content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to
 * group elements for styling purposes (using the class or id attributes),
 * or because they share attribute values, such as lang. It should be used
 * only when no other semantic element is appropriate. <span> is very much
 * like a div element, but div is a block-level element whereas a
 * <span> is an inline element.
